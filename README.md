# Travel Blog Concept

## Summary
I created this site as a fun personal project that would demonstrate my skillset regarding graphic design and web development technologies. 
The site was implemented using HTML, CSS/SASS, and JavaScript and was conceptualized using the design software Figma. 
<br><br>
This is merily a concept, and as such there are certain features that are not implemented. These features include pagination on the "Blog" page, 
as well as working contact forms on the "Contact" page. Hope you enjoy :)
